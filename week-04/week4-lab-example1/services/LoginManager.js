/**
 * This is just a placeholder for user services
 * - You might add your authentication services here for logins but also to get the current user
 * - In future classes we'll make a faux login that will retrieve the current user from an array in this file 
 *   and then maintain that user in state 
 * - for week 4 the only use will be to get the current user to make sure their favorites are kept separate from other users
